Acme-Stardate

A silly module for generating a "stardate" string based
on the local clock. Stardates are simple numerically and lexically
comparable strings that might be useful as version numbers.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardate documents a bit about the usage of
the term on Star Trek.  This module just generates sortable gmt date plus
a decimal fraction of a day precise enough to catch one second changes
